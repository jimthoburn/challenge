title: Vocational Training for At-Risk and Foster Youth
project_description: >-
  Lost Angels Children's Project (LACP) offers a vocational training and life
  skills development program after-school for disadvantaged youth in the
  under-resourced community of Lancaster. LACP provides a unique educational
  experience with hands-on learning by engaging in classic car repair and
  customization. The program prevents joblessness and homelessness, and promotes
  self-confidence, self-sufficiency and self-worth for more than 50 at-risk
  youth ages 13-19, most of which are in foster care.

  LACP was founded by Aaron Valencia in 2014, when a dozen at-risk youth and
  volunteers worked with him to restore and customize a 1931 Ford Roadster. A
  poster rendition of the car
   
   was sold for $20, which included a ticket to win the Roadster. The car was then raffled off at the Ventura Nationals, a yearly event for classic car enthusiasts, and the poster sale proceeds were donated to support youth programs at local homeless shelters. In 2015, LACP repeated the process by restoring a 1936 Ford Coupe. Each of these cars raised over $40,000 through the giveaway event. Mr. Valencia saw firsthand the difference the restoration project made to the young participants’ self-confidence and motivation and decided to concentrate his efforts on giving more kids the chance to get involved in this productive, character-building experience. In January 2016, LACP was incorporated and its revenue generating model of vocational job training through classic car restoration has helped to sustain services year after year. That year, LACP won a 2016 LA2050 Challenge Grant as one of the Best Places to Learn in Los Angeles. This grant was instrumental in launching LACP to the next level and our organization was able to leverage this support for gaining new donors, funders and resources. In 2017, LACP experienced a great amount of success in securing grants to further build organizational infrastructure. Among these, a Springboard Fund start-up grant from The Durfee Foundation provided two-years of funding and a personal mentor. Executive Director Steve LePore, who has over 30 years of experience working with non-profit organizations, has been providing one-on-one support and guidance for Mr. Valencia to help develop LACP. In addition, Mr. Valencia was recognized with a CNN Hero Award in December 2017 for his work and dedication; and this success was leveraged to grow LACP from a small workshop to a 5,000 square foot facility in the heart of Lancaster.

  LACP is committed to empowering youth through services that foster creativity
  and impart useful skills necessary to elevate students beyond their present
  condition to become positive participants in their community and transform
  their lives for a successful future. LACP collects testimonial evidence, tests
  students on their progress, tracks graduation rates, and is working on a
  system to monitor grades and school outcomes. Staff work one-on-one with
  students and their parents/guardians to ensure their individual and academic
  needs are being met. LACP tests students after workshops to measure knowledge
  and improved learning. Currently 100% of students have been passing their
  tests and, in the past year, 90% of LACP students graduated high school.
