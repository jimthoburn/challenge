title: Free WiFi & Internet of Things Connectivity
project_description: >-
  Our initial focus will be low data rate "things", followed by higher data rate
  voice and video. 
   
   The patented technology we've developed has won IEEE and a Google Research Awards after demonstrations in Barcelona and Philadelphia. Now we need to complete the coding, adding rules for mobility, and rules for devices people already own. We need WiFi research hardware, as well as the hardware that will create the first base station antennas at USC, the LA Chamber and the LA Cleantech Incubator.

  Our mission is to build a wireless Public Utility that would be paid for by
  the companies that make the devices we buy. The network will be autonomous,
  and so the antennas can be owned by anyone.
project_proposal_description: >-
  I grew up in northern New Jersey where my dad was an AT&T executive, so I knew
  all of the reasons that the phone company existed as a public utility.
  Customer proprietary network information (CPNI) is still the law of the land
  but unfortunately, the Trump FCC reversed the Obama FCC's Title II decision
  that would have made the law applicable to data networks. Regardless, M2M Bell
  can and will enforce our telecommunications laws because we will be the first
  packet network which can perform at the quality level of the old telephone
  networks, which never had security and performance issues because of the
  Quality of Service (QoS) between the Central Office and our homes
   
   . 
   
   To date, unfortunately, the only lives that have been impacted positively are the ones which have completed the previous research, where they won awards from the Spanish government, as well as from Alcatel and Vodafone. This helped those engineers get better jobs, or go onto better schools...like Zhang who is now at Stanford after winning awards for demonstrating our technology when he was at Bucknell. 
   
   
   
   Previous attempts to commercialize the technology included three presentations to the Silicon Valley Telecom Council. Invariably, the carriers will tell you that they're just operators and they don't make the gear. Then companies like Cisco and Juniper will tell you that it's true, they make the gear but they don't design the com chips...to be followed by Qualcomm and Broadcom, who will say, "If it's not going through standards and if we don't own the intellectual property, then what is there to talk about?"
   
   
   
   We have also sponsored grad student internships after we got our Google Award at USC. Unfortunately, Google didn't actually come through with the WiFi hardware they'd promised, citing an FCC rule that wouldn't let their Chinese OEMs ship an unlocked chip to the US. The lives we hope to impact the most, however, are the ones not yet born. Certainly, consumers will benefit across the board, but the end goal is for the next generation to know what it means to have their devices and communications supported by privacy law...just as the US Post Office intended, long before the privacy laws crossed over to telecommunication in the 1930's.

project_measure: >-
  When our first antenna goes live on campus, the other USC tech teams can run
  their applications within our attached servers. We will then approach the City
  as a founding member of the i3 Consortium, because the i3 platform is the open
  data exchange being developed at USC as the City's IoT platform. Verizon is
  also in the Consortium, so beating them to the punch in Los Angeles would be a
  fine measure of success...and of course, they too, can use our technology in
  their antenna base stations.
   
   
   
   Any legacy device using the network would also be considered a success, because that will be the first step to showing OEMs (and the semiconductor companies they buy from), that our technology needs to be embedded in their devices. Consumers and device companies will ultimately find more and more uses for anything that is free and can't be shut down. 
   
   
   
   Financial success will be determined by the "LA" metric, and we would expect to have a minimum of six after our first year of operations. In this case, LA stands for Licensing Agreements.
