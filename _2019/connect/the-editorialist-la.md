title: The Editorialist LA
project_description: >-
  I have already established a successful business with an audience of more than
  100,000 people across all my blog and social channels. Going forward, I need
  support to expand, hire employees, and relaunch the website to focus even more
  on Los Angeles and our local businesses. I would also use this support to
  create a web series focused on Los Angeles, with each episode exploring a new
  neighborhood, business, restaurant, activity, local figurehead, social
  service, and more.

  I believe LA boasts incredible untapped potential for content, so I launched
  my media company, The Editorialist LA, to provide curated content about Los
  Angeles to millennials, especially women.
project_proposal_description: >-
  I've always heard that Los Angeles is a “superficial” city—one that is “devoid
  of all culture,” existing solely for the rich, famous inhabitants and those
  vying to become them. Visitors flock to LA from all over, in search of a
  grandiose sense of glitz and glamour that left town a long time ago and maybe
  only ever existed on film. But that’s the problem with calling something
  superficial; those who do are guilty of the very sin themselves, as they have
  not put in the effort to dive beyond the surface to discover what lies
  beneath.
   
   In reality, LA has a deep, grounding culture that lives beneath that shiny surface. It's the lifeblood of the city, flowing through LA’s streets, crashing on our sandy shores, seeping out of the cracks in the sidewalk, expanding outward into the suburban sprawl. Our culture is a mishmash of moving parts. It is simultaneously elusive but still easily identifiable and strangely palpable, as if it lives in the rays of the sun or the cool ocean breeze. As full of contradictions and complexities as the inhabitants of the city themselves. And it is a culture that I strongly felt growing up in the Valley. This culture was the connective thread to my parents’ childhood neighborhoods. To my grandfather’s time at USC and his offices in Hollywood. To my Great Aunt’s boutique in Beverly Hills and her meetings at Canter’s Deli. To the homes in West LA where my parents lived when they met volunteering for the local City of Hope chapter. This culture has not just been the lifeblood of the city, but it runs through my blood as well.
   
   In 2014, I returned after earning my degree at Washington University in St. Louis to find a city that had transformed. Once classified as a black hole where culture goes to die, Los Angeles had gained acclaim as a food, fashion, and creative oasis. We now had a thriving and well-respected restaurant scene with some of the best up-and-coming chefs in the world, and an equally thriving art, fashion, culture, and start-up scene. This culture had always been there, but now it was out in the open, and others were finally starting to see it too. I believed the city boasted incredible untapped potential for content, so I launched my media company, The Editorialist LA.

project_measure: >-
  I will define and measure success by both qualitative and quantitative
  measures. The first is a qualitative measure of content; once we are able to
  redesign and relaunch the company, I will measure our success by the quality
  of the content we are now creating. Neighborhood guides, restaurant reviews,
  travel guides, video content, photo content, social media content will all
  need to improve. Second, I will define and measure success by a few
  quantitative metrics. The first is content output-- namely, how much more
  local content are we creating with the addition of new employees, freelance
  writers, editors, etc? I will be setting goals to create consistent content in
  the categories I defined above (and more), and how much of that content I
  should be producing per day, week, month, etc. Second, I will define and
  measure success by our audience metrics. I will take a look at our web and
  social data to see how the content is performing, how many more audience
  members we are acquiring, if our newsletter is expanding, how many more social
  media followers we've gained, etc.
