title: Emerging Content Creators Inclusion Initiative (ECCII)
project_description: >-
  NALIPâ€™s Emerging Content Creators Inclusion Initiative (ECCII) aims to provide
  support to young creators through forums, networking, mentorships, summer
  programs, workshops, and funding for projects that will be used for entrance
  into higher-education institutions. This activation targets young creatives
  who wish to enter the entertainment sphere but lack the knowledge, resources
  and mentorship.

  NALIP is a nonprofit whose mission is to discover, promote and inspire Latinx
  content creators and diverse voices across all media platforms.
project_proposal_description: >-
  NALIP works to turn inspiration into impact by providing creators with the
  resources and support they need to get their projects off the ground and
  advance their careers in this entertainment industry. Over last 20 years,
  NALIP has proudly equipped Latinx and diverse voices with the proper tools to
  enter the industry including funding for projects. 
   
   
   
   One example of how NALIP has impacted the industry and creatives is through our Latino Lens Incubator program. Through partnerships with the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and the Time Warner Foundation we have been able to fund short content projects for diverse filmmakers in the industry. 
   
   
   
   One of our most recent participants is Kase Pena, who was a finalist, screened her short film at our Media Fest, and is in the process of selling that film and distributing it to a major network. Through our mentorship process, we recommended her for a TV show that was staffing and looking for women, people of color, and Trans writers. Kase is currently a staffed writer on this show, earning writing credits from a major network.
   
   
   
   Another NALIP member who has also been a part of our programs is Nancy C. Mejia: she was a semifinalist for one of our Latino Lens Incubators. Through our programs, she was able to achieve her 3-5 year goal of being a writer into 18 months. She has most recently been staffed on a critically acclaimed TV series, VIDA on STARZ and was brought back for the second season to direct two episodes.
   
   
   
   NALIP strongly feels that the mentorship component of our programs is crucial to their success. It is through this, that creatives receive guidance to fortify their skills and obtain the necessary tools to advance in the industry. The NALIP Board of Directors, Executive Director, and staff all work together to connect with Latinx and diverse storytellers in need of hands-on support in order to develop strong careers in a very competitive industry that is slow to embrace Latinx and diverse creators, stories or content. This village, this concerted effort and proactive approach, allows for a continuous cycle of support and a strong foundation to ensure the longevity of inclusive voices and stories to this incredible industry.
