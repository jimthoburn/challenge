  Brendan Thompson, at only 17 years old participated in our first Youth
  Entrepreneur Training Program in the Summer of 2016. During the Youth
  Entrepreneur Training Program, Brendan learned about entrepreneurship, career
  development and leadership. By the end of the program Brendan Thompson had
  completed his own business plan, had an up-to-date professional resume and
  gained the leadership skills needed to be a successful business owner in the
  City of Los Angeles. Brendan is now 20 years old and is the owner of his own
  business Guild of Arts Los Angeles (GALA) to promote the arts in Los Angeles.
  By participating in ICON CDC's Youth Entrepreneur Training Program, Brendan
  was able to further developed his screen printing business called Freek
  Designs and began to flesh out the idea for GALA. For years, Brendan wanted to
  start a community arts center and at the Youth Entrepreneur Training Program,
  he got to think about it a lot more. After the Youth Entrepreneur Training
  Program, Brendan had the idea to start throwing art shows to get his arts
  center idea off the ground. Since completing the Youth Entrepreneur Training
  Program, Brendan has hosted many art shows with many vendors and activities
  for everyone under his GALA business. Brendan continues to grow both his
  business by utilizing the services that ICON CDC provides to all Youth
  Entrepreneur Training Program participants.

  Our success will be determined by evaluating entrance and exit interviews for
  each youth participant. Also, confidential feedback surveys will be handed out
  after each entrepreneur training workshop to evaluate workshop material,
  speaker and instructor. In addition, our program evaluation includes setting
  goals for all the metrics we are proposing to effect and tracking the outcomes
  for each post program. At the end of the Youth Entrepreneur Training Program,
  each youth participant that successfully completes the program is assigned to
  an ICON CDC Business Coach that will meet with them and follow up with them on
  a monthly basis to assist them with ongoing business, career, financial
  literacy and leadership development.An action plan will be created to access
  their needs and guide them through their next steps.
