title: '#LAGREENTEEN'
project_description: >-
  Our #LAGREENTEEN program teaches inner-city Angeleno youth about
  environmentalism and reduction of single-use plastics through a 4 part
  workshop. LA HIGH is the first school we are working with (March & April
  2019). We seek to install clean water filtration units throughout LA High
  school and plan to repeat this with other LAUSD schools as well. Without these
  units students are forced to buy plastic water bottles as their source of
  water as their school water is unsafe to drink.

  For nine years, Crayon Collection has been dedicated to breaking a cycle of
  waste while at the same time supporting teachers and children in classrooms
  around LA and beyond our city. The idea was born when seeing like-new crayons
  be discarded by restaurant staff at kid-friendly restaurants at a rate of 150
  million crayons/year. Crayons do not decompose as they are made of paraffin
  wax. In addition, the norm of tossing still good crayons worsened the
  "throw-away society" Americans are known for and kids were watching this
  happen over and over again. We had to re-think trash as our landfills were
  overfilled and trash had to be transported miles away from Los Angeles via
  train. We started to pair local underserved Title 1 schools with participating
  restaurants who agreed to collect the still good crayons for us. Local schools
  would pick up over 2500 crayons per month for homework and a variety of art
  projects. Crayon Collection broke a cycle of waste that was longstanding and
  many people never considered and instilled a new mindset. Next, we challenged
  LA based artists to create projects ideas using just crayons so students could
  have robust art education curriculum, another program that was cut in public
  schools. The Crayon Collection model was an example of how we can do better
  but thinking of solutions. It was at these very same restaurants that we
  noticed full glasses of water with plastic straws in them that no one ordered.
  We realized that this was a "habit of waste" that needed to be changed as
  ewll. We spearheaded the ban on plastic straws and cutlery in the iconic City
  of Malibu, which ignited worldwide change against single-use plastics. We
  launched a new program called Habits of Waste to address more environmental
  issues including plastics and many other things. Then #LAGREENTEEN allows us
  to reduce dependency on plastic water bottles in LAUSD schools by providing
  another solution - filtered water units. Creating a new “eco-normal”
  consciousness that focuses on stewardship of the environment and support of
  nearby communities in need. Now, we are inspiring environmental action &
  career building for low-income students who have less access to environmental
  opportunities than their affluent counterparts.

  We have surveys to asses student behavior and dependency on single-use
  plastics at the beginning and at the end of the program. We anticipate a drop
  in usage once they learn more about the harm single use plastics have on the
  environment. Also, we know how many plastic water bottles and sodas are being
  purchased each day, prior to the installation of the 5 water filtration
  stations. We will reassess after the students have the option of free clean
  water to see how many plastic water bottles are being sold per day.
