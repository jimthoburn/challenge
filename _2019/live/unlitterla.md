title: UnlitterLA
project_description: >-
  UnlitterLA is a boots-on-the-ground massive volunteer event based on a simple
  concept powered by technology and social media, to occur one to two times per
  year. For the effort to have maximum impact on residents throughout the
  region, financial and in-kind support for marketing, press relations, and
  execution of the project is needed.

  Inspiring LA pride through mass street litter cleanup events, that are highly
  visible for those not participating. Our goals are increased civic pride,
  cleaner streets and cleaner waterways.
project_proposal_description: >-
  "Nobody Walks In L.A." is a myth - our region is a mecca of outdoor sports
  enthusiasts, from hikers to cyclists, to urban walkers. The more our residents
  get out of their cars and onto the streets, the more appreciation they have of
  the colorful tapestry of neighborhoods and people that make up the city.
  Social media has enabled large groups of like-minded individuals to explore
  our urban environments, walking hundreds of miles of the city. Walking leads
  to a belief in the value of public transit, quality public spaces, and clean
  streets. Frustrated by the amount of trash left on the streets and sidewalks,
  some of these people teamed up with friends to come out and do a series of
  impromptu trash pickups. On a Sunday in 2018, a small group of us cleaned
  about a mile and a half of Hollywood streets in about an hour and a half.
  Residents, business owners, and even passing motorists cheered the effort.
  Afterward, we asked "how can we upscale this to cover a large portion of the
  city?" Knowing there are thousands of L.A. residents who not only enjoy
  walking, but would likely pitch in to do a manageable walk that results in a
  mass citywide cleanup, it was clear that this was about creating a simple
  concept on a audacious scale. Using inspiration from the grassroots #UNLITTER
  or #TRASHTAG movement, and from the mass just-for-fun "Great Walk of L.A.," we
  created the concept for a one-day organized trash pickup event, where nearly
  650 miles of streets will be “unlittered” in just a few hours. Volunteers in
  teams will each walk one of 160+ 4-mile loop routes starting and ending at an
  LA Metro station. Using mobile technology and social media, UnlitterLA
  promises to be the biggest mass street cleanup ever attempted, and as a
  regular event, it can make a significant difference in the appearance of our
  city as well as the actions of our residents. Months later, walking down that
  same Hollywood street we cleaned several months ago, we can still see a
  noticeable difference and we're proud for even the small bit we've achieved.
  We want to share this pride citywide!

  The project success will not be defined as a binary result - it will be about
  how well the planning and execution achieves the stated goals. We have a
  series of metrics we can measure. These include:
   
   
   
   - Number of volunteers who participate in the event. This will directly impact how many routes can be cleaned; however, there is no necessity for all routes to be serviced. The effort will be beneficial at any level
   
   
   
   - Miles of streets cleaned
   
   
   
   - Number of bags (and estimated weight) of litter picked up
   
   
   
   - Level of official participation by cities impacted by the effort
   
   
   
   - Number of other organizations (churches, youth groups, schools, and corporations) that provide participation and support
   
   
   
   - Levels of sponsorships, including funds raised by route and event sponsors, and in-kind sponsors of supplies
   
   
   
   - Effectiveness of technology tools, including mapping, volunteer sign-ups, registration, and tracking of street-gathered data after the cleanup occurs
   
   
   
   - Feedback from participants, including their interactions with the organization, the process, the routes, and their level of satisfaction
   
   
   
   - Feedback from residents not volunteering but who may be impacted. A random survey of awareness before and after the event will inform PR and marketing efforts for future events.
