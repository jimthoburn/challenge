<h2>
  Welcome to the
  <span class="avoid-break">2019 My LA2050</span>
  <span class="avoid-break">Grants Challenge</span>
</h2>

LA2050 is a community-guided initiative driving and tracking progress toward a shared vision for the future of Los Angeles. With the support of 30,000 Angelenos, we’ve outlined an aspirational vision centered on five goals and 60+ metrics tracked over time to evaluate how Los Angeles is faring. We've supported 42 great projects to shape a better LA via the My LA2050 Grants Challenge.<br /><br /><strong>The My LA2050 Grants Challenge is an open call for ideas that will activate 100,000 Angelenos to make LA the best place to learn, create, play, connect, and live.<br /><br />A total of $1,000,000</strong> will be awarded among five organizations to implement their ideas to engage Angelenos. Each organization will receive a total of $200,000 (over two years) and [partnership from LA2050](/about/#la2050-partnership) in support of their efforts.

<strong>Now, we're asking for your help to turn the [LA2050 goals and metrics](/about/#goals) into action.</strong>

## Winners Selection

Winners will be selected via a two-step process:

**25 <mark>finalists</mark> will be selected by an evaluation committee**: LA2050 will nominate an evaluation committee comprised of community members and experts to review and score applications. The evaluation committee will select 25 <mark>finalists</mark>—five in each goal category.

**5 winning proposals will be selected by the public**: The public will vote on the <mark>finalists</mark>. The activations in each goal category that receive the most votes will be announced as the winners.

The <mark>finalists</mark> will represent a diverse set of issues, engagement strategies, and activation goals. <mark>Finalists</mark> will be selected using the following criteria:

* Impact on the [LA2050 goals and metrics](/about/#goals)
* Overall quality of the application
* Feasibility
* Ability to mobilize the LA community
* Collaborative spirit
