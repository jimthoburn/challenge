<h2>
  <span class="avoid-break">How would</span>
  <span class="avoid-break">you activate</span>

</h2>

LA2050 is a community-guided initiative driving and tracking progress toward a shared vision for the future of Los Angeles. With the support of 30,000 Angelenos, we’ve outlined an aspirational vision centered on five goals and 60+ metrics tracked over time to evaluate how Los Angeles is faring. We've supported 42 great projects to shape a better LA via the My LA2050 Grants Challenge.<br /><br /><strong>The My LA2050 Grants Challenge is an open call for ideas that will activate 100,000 Angelenos to make LA the best place to learn, create, play, connect, and live.<br /><br />A total of $1,000,000</strong> will be awarded among five organizations to implement their ideas to engage Angelenos. Each organization will receive a total of $200,000 (over two years) and [partnership from LA2050](/about/#la2050-partnership) in support of their efforts.

<strong>Now, we're asking for your help to turn the [LA2050 goals and metrics](/about/#goals) into action.</strong>
