## Join us to harness our region’s civic activism for a better Los Angeles.

LA2050 is a community-guided initiative driving and tracking progress toward a shared vision for the future of Los Angeles. With the support of 30,000 Angelenos, we’ve outlined an [aspirational vision](https://la2050.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/reports/1/pdfs/vision_for_a_successful_los_angeles.pdf?1441226432) centered on [five goals](https://la2050.org/goals) and [60+ metrics](https://www.la2050.org/metrics) tracked over time to evaluate how Los Angeles is faring. We've supported [](https://www.la2050.org/grantees) [42 great project](https://www.la2050.org/grantees)[s](https://www.la2050.org/grantees) to shape a better LA via the My LA2050 Grants Challenge. 

Now, we're asking for your help to turn the LA2050 goals and metrics into action.

## What do we mean by activation?

<strong>
  <span style="">
    <span style="max-width: 9em; display: block;">We don’t want to limit your imagination, so <em>think big!</em></span>
  </span>
</strong>

We envision activations ranging from engaging people on issue advocacy to helping change individual or consumer behavior to creating technology that makes it easier participate locally. The main goal is to think about the power of Angelenos and how all can take part in crafting a brighter future for the LA of our dreams.

Read our [guidelines for proposals](/submit/#guidelines).
