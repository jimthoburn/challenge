### What is LA2050?

LA2050 is a community-guided initiative driving and tracking progress towards a shared vision for the future of Los Angeles. We believe that in order achieve a more thriving, prosperous, and equitable region, we must be united by a clear vision of success for the region. So we partnered with organizations to reach 30,000 Angelenos and created an [aspirational vision](https://la2050.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/reports/1/pdfs/vision_for_a_successful_los_angeles.pdf?1441226432) centered on [five goals](https://la2050.org/goals): _to make Los Angeles the best place to learn, create, play, connect, and live by the year 2050_. And to make sure it was smart and academically defensible, we received input from advisors and expert stakeholders.

We also worked with our community to develop [60+ metrics](https://www.la2050.org/metrics) that we’re tracking over time to evaluate how Los Angeles is faring. And to ignite action, we launched the My LA2050 Grants Challenge in 2013—_an open call for project ideas to shape a better Los Angeles_—to inspire action and move the needle on the goals and metrics.

Through the grants challenge, 1100+ creative and innovative proposals were submitted to build a better LA. With the help of 200,000 individuals who voted on their favorite proposals, $4M in funds were granted to [42 organizations](https://la2050.org/grantees) shaping a brighter future for Los Angeles.

LA2050 is a community-guided initiative driving and tracking progress toward a shared vision for the future of Los Angeles. With the support of 30,000 Angelenos we’ve outlined an [aspirational vision](https://la2050.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/reports/1/pdfs/vision_for_a_successful_los_angeles.pdf?1441226432) centered on [five goals](https://la2050.org/goals): to make Los Angeles the best place to learn, create, play, connect, and live by the year 2050. We’re also tracking our progress by evaluating [60+ metrics](https://www.la2050.org/metrics) over time that assess how Los Angeles is faring.

In 2013, we launched our first signature program, the My LA2050 Grants Challenge, to inspire action and move the needle on the goals and metrics.

And now we want your help to take all of this work to the next level! We want you to help us answer: how can we engage 100,000 Angelenos to make measurable progress towards achieving our shared vision?

### What is the Activation Challenge?

This is an open call via for ideas to activate 100,000 Angelenos to make Los Angeles the best place to learn, create, play, connect, and live. A total of $1M will be awarded to five organizations--one per goal category—to implement their ideas to engage Angelenos. Each organization will receive a total of $200,000 over two years to support their efforts.

The activations should aim to engage Angelenos to make a specific, tangible impact on one of the LA2050 goals and metrics by 2020. The activations can use a variety of engagement strategies to create progress, including but not limited to policy advocacy, volunteering, buycotts/boycotts, digital activism, or use of civic tech.

LA2050 will commit to a two-year partnership to leveraging its resources, assets, and networks to help the activations succeed. Together, the winning organizations, LA2050, and Angelenos will produce five major wins for the region that will change the course of our future.

### How can LA2050 partner with my organization?

_We want to work together! To partner, we plan on:_

* Leveraging the LA2050 community to support and participate in the activation campaign
* Leading on planning public programming, including events, to connect its community to the activation campaign
* Offering communications assistance to help the coalition advance thought leadership, including authoring articles, op-eds, and blog posts
* Amplifying messaging on social media and via its newsletter to support the campaigns
* Designing assets for materials
* Providing technical assistance, strategic input and guidance, and access to experts to incorporate insights on building successful campaigns

### 100,000 is a lot of people! Do we have to activate them all at once?

100,000 is an exciting number of Angelenos to get involved in local issues. And it’ll be no easy feat. We anticipate that the number of people activated will occur over two years and will take many forms. Some people will just receive and open an email, others will actually click on something and show up to a meeting, others will become super volunteers or community organizers. We anticipate that successful activations will create a clear ladder of engagement that take people from unengaged to superstar activists, organizers, volunteers, etc.

### How will you measure the number of people activated?

Great question! We’re leaning on applicants to define how they plan to reach Angelenos and the number of people that will be reached via their various engagement strategies. We expect that Angelenos will be reached via social media, phone calls, in-person engagement, volunteerism, to name a few methods.

### Why did you start the My LA2050 Activation Challenge?

LA is experiencing an exciting and important moment in civic activism. While we are inspired by those sparks of civic activism, by many traditional measures, LA lacks civic engagement on a local level. Further, many Angelenos report not knowing how to help address the issues they care about most.

### Are there restrictions on what the activations can address?

Yes: 501(c)4 activities are not eligible for funding; activations cannot be focused on supporting or opposing candidates for public office; activations cannot have voter registration as the main object. Things that are okay though include Get-Out-The-Vote efforts, candidate briefings, candidate questionnaires, and candidate forums and debates. Be sure to check the My LA2050 Activation Challenge rules.

### I have feedback on the LA2050 goals. How can I share that with you? 

We want your feedback! Email us at [connect@la2050.org](mailto:connect@la2050.org) with your feedback.

We want Angelenos to see themselves as part of the solutions we need to improve our region. And we want to tap into the expertise of the organizations, agencies, and companies who have great ideas about how to boost engagement on local issues.

### Can I apply more than once?

Technically there can be multiple entries from the same organization, so long as the submissions are unique and in different categories. However, we would recommend consolidating your resources, collaborators, and supporters and submitting one awesome proposal!

### What are the benefits of applying?

_Beyond the potential to receive funds to address an issue you’re passionate about, we also believe that applying in this challenge will provide additional benefits including:_

* The opportunity to participate in a first-of-its-kind regional effort
* Increasing awareness and exposure around an issue important for LA’s future
* Helping to create or crystallize a campaign, civic engagement, or mobilization idea
* Increased understanding of the LA social impact landscape
* The opportunity to cultivate and build new relationships with peers
* The chance to build a coalition of committed Angelenos and organizations to support an important issue for LA
* The opportunity to learn how to tell a compelling story about your organization’s impact
* Inspires the creation of videos, photos, tweets, and pithy messaging to promote your proposal
* Visibility in front of other foundations and potential alternative funding sources. Past challenges have resulted in $2M in grants from outside funding using the LA2050 platform for their grantmaking

### What kinds of activations are you looking to support?

_We’re open! But here are some ideas about what we’re looking for:_

* Bold efforts that will produce measurable wins for the LA region
* Activations with clear pathways for Angelenos to get involved
* A spirit of collaboration and desire to unify and amplify collective efforts
* Clear focus on inclusion, diversity of voices, and equity
* Efforts that not only produce positive results but are focused on increasinglocal engagement and civic participation
* A desire to test new strategies

### What are some tips for submitting ideas to the My LA2050 Activation Challenge?

_Collaborate._ We are eager to see folks working together to improve Los Angeles.

_Think about impact._ Be imaginative and audacious. We want to hear your most ambitious ideas – but we also want to know that your activation campaign is feasible, implementable, and that it could impact the LA2050 goals and metrics outlined by a community of Angelenos.

Share how your activation campaign will impact the LA2050 goal you are focusing on. For example, if you’ve chosen LA is the best place to learn, you might describe how your activation campaign will improve graduation rates; if you’ve chosen LA is the best place to connect, you might explain how your activation campaign will increase voting rates or volunteerism.

We want to see that you’ve considered how to create a ladder of engagement for Angelenos. Show in your submission that you’re thinking about someone’s journey from uninformed to an activist for social change.

Be sure to explain why you think the activation campaign strategy and engagement methods are the best course of action for impacting the goal and metrics.

Videos can help quickly articulate your project or your organization’s mission. To include a video, use a YouTube URL. If you don’t have a video, be sure to include a high-resolution photo that represents your idea or organization. Photos should be in JPG, PNG, or GIF format, at least 570 × 345 pixels. We suggest limiting attachment files to 5 MB each.

Please note that when uploading documents file names containing special characters (!@#$%^&\*()) are not allowed and file names should be less than or equal to 30 characters.

Applicants should not expect to be able to revise their applications after the submission date.

Your application goes through a moderation process, and will show up on the site if it is approved. If we have questions about your application, we will be in touch.
