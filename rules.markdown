# FAQs

### What is LA2050?

LA2050 is a community-guided initiative driving and tracking progress towards a shared vision for the future of Los Angeles. We believe that in order achieve a more thriving, prosperous, and equitable region, we must be united by a clear vision of success for the region. So we partnered with organizations to reach 30,000 Angelenos and created a vision! And to make sure it was smart and academically defensible, we received input from advisors and expert stakeholders.

We also worked with our community to develop 60+ metrics that we’re tracking over time to evaluate how Los Angeles is faring. And to ignite action, we launched the My LA2050 Grants Challenge in 2013 which was an open call for project ideas to shape a better Los Angeles.

  
You can read about vision, goals, and the metrics we’re using to track progress [here](https://la2050.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/reports/1/pdfs/vision_for_a_successful_los_angeles.pdf?1441226432). Our website also includes information about our [goals](https://la2050.org/goals) and [metrics](https://la2050.org/metrics).

### 100,000 is a lot of people! Do we have to activate them all at once?

100,000 is an exciting number of Angelenos to get involved in local issues. And it’ll be no easy feat. We anticipate that the number of people activated will occur over two years and will take many forms. Some people will just receive and open an email, others will actually click on something and show up to a meeting, others will become super volunteers or community organizers. We anticipate that successful activations will create a clear ladder of engagement that take people from unengaged to superstar activists, organizers, volunteers, etc.

### How will you measure the number of people activated?

Great question! We’re leaning on applicants to define how they plan to reach Angelenos and the number of people that will be reached via their various engagement strategies. We expect that Angelenos will be reached via social media, phone calls, in-person engagement, volunteerism, to name a few methods.

### Why did you start the My LA2050 Activation Challenge?

LA is experiencing an exciting and important moment in civic activism. While we are inspired by those sparks of civic activism, by many traditional measures, LA lacks civic engagement on a local level. Further, many Angelenos report not knowing how to help address the issues they care about most.

### Are there restrictions on what the activations can address?

Yes: 501(c)4 activities are not eligible for funding; activations cannot be focused on supporting or opposing candidates for public office; activations cannot have voter registration as the main object. Things that are okay though include Get-Out-The-Vote efforts, candidate briefings, candidate questionnaires, and candidate forums and debates. Be sure to check the My LA2050 Activation Challenge rules.

### I have feedback on the LA2050 goals. How can I share that with you? 

We want your feedback! Email us at connect@la2050.org with your feedback.

We want Angelenos to see themselves as part of the solutions we need to improve our region. And we want to tap into the expertise of the organizations, agencies, and companies who have great ideas about how to boost engagement on local issues.

### Can I apply more than once?

Technically there can be multiple entries from the same organization, so long as the submissions are unique and in different categories. However, we would recommend consolidating your resources, collaborators, and supporters and submitting one awesome proposal!

### What are some tips for submitting ideas to the My LA2050 Activation Challenge?

Collaborate. We are eager to see folks working together to improve Los Angeles.

Think about impact. Be imaginative and audacious. We want to hear your most ambitious ideas – but we also want to know that your activation campaign is feasible, implementable, and that it could impact the LA2050 goals and metrics outlined by a community of Angelenos.

Share how your activation campaign will impact the LA2050 goal you are focusing on. For example, if you’ve chosen LA is the best place to learn, you might describe how your activation campaign will improve graduation rates; if you’ve chosen LA is the best place to connect, you might explain how your activation campaign will increase voting rates or volunteerism.

We want to see that you’ve considered how to create a ladder of engagement for Angelenos. Show in your submission that you’re thinking about someone’s journey from uninformed to an activist for social change.

Be sure to explain why you think the activation campaign strategy and engagement methods are the best course of action for impacting the goal and metrics.

Videos can help quickly articulate your project or your organization’s mission. To include a video, use a YouTube URL. If you don’t have a video, be sure to include a high-resolution photo that represents your idea or organization. Photos should be in JPG, PNG, or GIF format, at least 570 × 345 pixels. We suggest limiting attachment files to 5 MB each.

Please note that when uploading documents file names containing special characters (!@#$%^&\*()) are not allowed and file names should be less than or equal to 30 characters.

Applicants should not expect to be able to revise their applications after the submission date.

Your application goes through a moderation process, and will show up on the site if it is approved. If we have questions about your application, we will be in touch.
