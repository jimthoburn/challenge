  Ucivity app is a revolutionary tool that helps citizens organize themselves
  around shared hyper-local needs, crowdsource solutions, and actively shape
  public space.
project_proposal_description: >-
  We will build a revolutionary app that enables a true bottom-up approach to
  public space improvement. The app gives any Angeleno regardless of age, race,
  or ties to local government an opportunity to be heard and actively
  participate in shaping public spaces. Citizens, neighborhood organizations and
  local officials will be able to use 
   
   Ucivity to create together hundred and thousands of unique public space solutions in the city and activate millions of Angelenos.

  Eric Garcetti, Mayor of City of Los Angeles once said that the city’s small
  issues are the hardest to solve, not the large infrastructure challenges like
  freeways or subways. 
   
   
   
   Currently, it is impossible for local governments to know about every single hyper-local need in every community, especially when the decision makers do not live in the community. However it is local government that makes the majority of the public space improvement decisions — often with little to no information about the community’s needs and without the input of those who live in the community and will be the end-users. 
   
   
   
   Ucivity aims to solve this challenge with a bottom-up approach to public space improvement. Ucivity empowers any Angeleno, regardless of age, race, or ties to local government with an opportunity to be heard and actively participate in shaping public space.
   
   
   
   
   
   Ucivity is a free social app that puts the end-users in the driver’s seat. The app helps Angelenos point out and confirm public space needs in the community, organize themselves around hyper-local needs, brainstorm creative solutions, crowdfund a project if needed, and get officials to act through healthy social pressure. The gamification of the app makes the user-experience fun and rewarding.
   
   
   
   Due to shortage of funds in the city, many great public space projects never become a reality. 
   
   
   
   To help solve the funding gap, Ucivity implements a state of the art civic crowdfunding mechanism that gives Angelenos more control over the public space destiny as the funds go directly to the projects they were raised for. 
   
   
   
   One of the big challenges of crowdfunding platforms is that many people have no experience running a successful campaign. Through Ucivity, users who have previously run successful campaigns are rewarded for being mentors to newbies. Mentorship can significantly increase crowdfunding success rate and as a result increase the number of quality spaces to play in LA. 
   
   
   
   On Ucivity neighborhood organizations and non-profits can effectively engage with communities and post volunteer opportunities which are matched with local volunteers.
   
   
   
   
   
   Local officials can use the app to learn about most important public space needs and prioritize accordingly. Because the app makes community needs transparent, it keeps local officials accountable and encourages them to work in the interest of their constituents.
   
   
   
   As citizens engage and take pride in the public spaces they actively helped create - maintenance costs, waste, vandalism, and crime, all decrease.
   
   
   
   With Ucivity, Angelenos can, not only improve the quality of the over 3,000 existing public parks, beaches, school yards, and streets in LA county, but also identify and bring to life unique spaces that do not exist yet. This helps significantly increase the number of quality, intergenerational, and vibrant spaces in Los Angeles
project_proposal_engage: >-
  The free Ucivity app can be used by anyone in LA. While the app will benefit
  every community in LA, we will begin on-boarding underserved communities first
  as these communities can achieve the greatest impact.
   
   
   
   We will conduct training sessions at public parks throughout the county to ensure an initial critical mass of users become expert users. We will train neighborhood organizations on how to engage the community and attract more volunteers. 
   
   
   
   To further accelerate activation, we will help neighborhood organizations and city departments utilize Ucivity for planned projects. This could entail, for example, running a community outreach to obtain ideas from end-users for a new proposed park. This approach will provide planners and designers with invaluable user-centric information that shall be used to create spaces Angelenos will love. 
   
   
   
   We plan to collaborate with the Department of Recreation and Parks to help improve quality of over 3,000 parks in LA County. To showcase the magnitude of impact Ucivity can create, we will run one of the first pilot projects at the Pan Pacific Park. The goal is to reactivate the park by converting a large eye-sore structure into an unique public art landmark. Via contest street artists submit proposals to the app and community members vote for the proposal they want to become a reality. A true crowdsourced solution as design and decision are provided by the community. This one project alone can activate over 100,000 park visits a year.
project_measure: >-
  Success of the Ucivity app will be measured not only by utilization of the app
  itself and its ability to get Angelenos engaged in the process, but also by
  the quality of the end result and its ability to facilitate public space
  projects into fruition.
   
   
   
   To measure engagement with the app and help improve ease of use, we will look at app usage metrics like number of active users and number of ideas submitted per day. 
   
   
   
   To measure the success of geographic coverage but also help understand which areas need further activation, we will look at idea submissions per neighborhood, public parks, beaches and other geo-specific areas like LA River. 
   
   
   
   To measure volunteer activation we will look at metrics like the number of volunteer opportunities posted and the number of confirmed volunteers. 
   
   
   
   To measure the success of donor activation we will look at metrics like number of fully funded crowdfunding campaigns, total amount raised, and success rate of campaigns. A crowdfunded project indicates high probability of project’s installation and user-centric design.
   
   
   
   To measure the role of Ucivity in adding vibrant, unique and intergenerational spaces to play in LA we will be tracking the number of public space installments initiated on Ucivity; type of improvements e.g. kids, seniors, arts, or sports; and number of public space improvements outside parks or beaches. 
   
   
   
   Our analytic tools will show metrics in real-time and help us make strategic decisions about next activation steps.
project_five_years: >-
  5 years from now Ucivity will have activated millions of Angelenos and have
  created a paradigm shift in governance of public space. 
   
   Majority of hyper-local projects in LA are going to be initiated on Ucivity and planned jointly by the community/end-users local government bodies. 
   
   
   
   Los Angeles will see a significant increase in Angelenos utilizing public space as it was built exactly for their need. Each community will have developed it’s unique public space fabric that represents perfectly its culture and needs. 
   
   
   
   The app will become the number one go to tool for local governments and organizations to engage with communities and obtain user-centric data. 
   
   
   
   5 years from now Ucivity will be used in cities nationally and internationally. The app will have expanded its functionality. Among other functionalities it will allow citizens participate in and vote on items at public hearings via live stream.
