# About the _My LA2050_ Activation Challenge

## LA2050

LA2050 is a community-guided initiative driving and tracking progress toward a shared vision for the future of Los Angeles. With the support of 30,000 Angelenos we’ve outlined an [aspirational vision](https://la2050.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/reports/1/pdfs/vision_for_a_successful_los_angeles.pdf?1441226432) centered on [five goals](https://la2050.org/goals): to make Los Angeles the best place to learn, create, play, connect, and live by the year 2050. We’re also tracking our progress by evaluating [60+ metrics](https://www.la2050.org/metrics) over time that assess how Los Angeles is faring.

In 2013, we launched our first signature program, the My LA2050 Grants Challenge, to inspire action and move the needle on the goals and metrics. Through the grants challenge, 1100+ creative and innovative proposals were submitted to build a better LA. With the help of 200,000 individuals who voted on their favorite proposals, $4M in funds were granted to [42 organizations](https://la2050.org/grantees) shaping a brighter future for Los Angeles.

And now we want your help to take all of this work to the next level! We want you to help us answer: how can we engage 100,000 Angelenos to make measurable progress towards achieving our shared vision?

## Activation Challenge

This is an open call via for ideas to activate 100,000 Angelenos to make Los Angeles the best place to learn, create, play, connect, and live. A total of $1M will be awarded to five organizations--one per goal category—to implement their ideas to engage Angelenos. Each organization will receive a total of $200,000 over two years to support their efforts.

The activations should aim to engage Angelenos to make a specific, tangible impact on one of the LA2050 goals and metrics by 2020. The activations can use a variety of engagement strategies to create progress, including but not limited to policy advocacy, volunteering, buycotts/boycotts, digital activism, or use of civic tech.

LA2050 will commit to a two-year partnership to leveraging its resources, assets, and networks to help the activations succeed. Together, the winning organizations, LA2050, and Angelenos will produce five major wins for the region that will change the course of our future.
