## LA2050 is a community-guided initiative driving and tracking progress toward a shared vision for the future of Los Angeles.

With the support of 30,000 Angelenos, we’ve outlined an [aspirational vision](https://la2050.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/reports/1/pdfs/vision_for_a_successful_los_angeles.pdf) centered on [five goals](/about/#goals): to make Los Angeles the best place to learn, create, play, connect, and live by the year 2050. We’re also tracking our progress by evaluating [60+ metrics](https://www.la2050.org/metrics) that assess how Los Angeles is faring.

In 2013, we launched our first signature program, the My LA2050 Grants Challenge, to inspire action and move the needle on the goals and metrics. Through the grants challenge, 1100+ creative and innovative proposals were submitted to build a better LA. With the help of hundreds of thousands of individuals who voted on their favorite proposals, LA2050 granted more than $5M to almost [50 organizations](https://la2050.org/grantees) shaping a brighter future for Los Angeles.

And now we want your help to continue this work!

## About the My LA2050 Grants Challenge

This is an open call for ideas to make Los Angeles the best place to learn, create, play, connect, and live. A total of $1M will be awarded among 25 organizations—five per goal category—to implement their ideas to turn inspiration into impact. <mark>Each organization will receive a total of $100,000 over one year to support its efforts.</mark>

The proposals should aim to engage Angelenos to make a specific, tangible impact on one of the [LA2050 goals and metrics](/about/#goals) by <mark>2020</mark>.

LA2050 will commit to a one-year partnership, leveraging its resources, assets, and networks to help the projects succeed. Together, the winning organizations, LA2050, and Angelenos will create progress for the region that will change the course of our future.
