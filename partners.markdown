## 2020 Partners

The My LA2050 Grants Challenge would not be possible without the support of our incredible partners.

**Evaluation Partner: Social Venture Partners Los Angeles**

This year, we've chosen Social Venture Partners Los Angeles (SVP) to serve as our external evaluation partner.

SVP is a membership organization that connects community leaders to nonprofits to tackle Los Angeles' toughest challenges. SVP Partners - nonprofit professionals, business executives, and other local changemakers - donate their time, skills, money, and networks to amplify the most impactful efforts transforming our region. 

SVP Partners will serve on evaluation teams to review and score applications, ultimately recommending finalists in each of the five goal categories - LIVE, LEARN, PLAY, CONNECT, and CREATE. The 25 finalists will then proceed to an online voting round, where public vote will determine the grant winners in each category.
